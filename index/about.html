                        <h2>How Did I Become a Designer?</h2>
                        <h3>Every journey has its own rhythm. Not all paths are step-by-step linear; I do have my own zig-zags. Let's dive into it together.</h3>
                        <overline>MY SELF-DISCOVERY JOURNEY —</overline>
                        <p>My first introduction to design came during high school in Human Sciences, where I took on the role of creating visuals for our class presentations. I have always been fascinated by psychology, particularly in understanding the reasons behind human behavior. This early interest in both graphic design and psychology laid the foundation for my future in design.</p>
                        <p><span>After high school, I pursued a bachelor's degree in Communication Design. While I enjoyed creating visual artifacts, I found myself longing for a deeper understanding of the data and market research that could provide insights into the audiences my work was aimed at. One of my favorite quotes that really speaks to me comes from W. Edwards Deming:</span></p>
                        <blockquote><h3>"Without data, you are just another person with an opinion."</h3></blockquote>
                        <p>This perspective led me to pursue a master's degree in Marketing. My background in communication design intersected with my studies in marketing, blending creativity with an analytical approach. This synergy represented an opportunity for me to create something new and unique. How?</p>
                        <h3>By combining creativity with a data-driven mindset.</h3>
                        <p>However, it was only after my study abroad experience in Portugal that everything changed. I met a UX/UI designer who opened my eyes to the possibility of merging my creative instincts with analytical thinking. This encounter ignited a spark in me, prompting me to enroll in a specialized master's program in UX/UI design.</p>
                        <p>One of the projects I worked on centered around accessibility and deeply inspired me. I am continuously exploring new facets of accessibility, </p>
                        <h3>aspiring to become a UX/UI Accessibility Expert.</h3>
                        <p>Throughout this journey, I have embraced my zig-zags, each contributing to the designer I am today. I have realized that true innovation stands at the intersection of creativity and data-driven insights, and I am eager to explore the endless possibilities that this combination unlocks.</p>

                        <p>My creativity is enhanced by my hobbies in yoga, surfing, and trekking. Yoga helps me find balance and clarity, allowing me to find a sense of calm.</p>
                        <p>Then there's surfing, which adds a thrilling element to my life. Riding the waves is not just about the adrenaline; it teaches me to be adaptable and to embrace spontaneity.</p>
                        <p>And speaking of nature, trekking allows me to connect deeply with nature, providing a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Each hike presents an opportunity to observe the world around me — the colors, textures, and sounds — all of which inspire my creativity.</p>
